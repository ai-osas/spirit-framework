# Spirit Framework Business Plan

## Executive Summary

Spirit Framework is a decentralized learning intelligence platform built on the Electroneum blockchain that transforms personal learning experiences into collective wisdom. At its core is Spirit Journalâ€”a space where users document their learning journeys, from overcoming challenges to achieving breakthroughs, and are rewarded with SPIRIT tokens for meaningful contributions.

The platform addresses the challenge of one-size-fits-all educational approaches by harnessing the power of personal journaling to create a foundation for future adaptive learning technologies. Our business model combines token rewards, premium features, and API access to create a sustainable ecosystem that grows in value as the learning intelligence database expands.

With an initial focus on the Spirit Journal product, our roadmap includes developing Spirit Study (an adaptive learning companion) and Spirit Code (a developer extension) to form a comprehensive learning ecosystem powered by collective intelligence.
